# (PART) Case studies {-}

# Introduction {-}

This third part `Case studies` provides real-world case studies from the scientific literature that you can reproduce using material covered in previous chapters. These problems can either i) be used to cement and deepen your understanding of methods and models, ii) be adapted for your own purpose, or iii) serve as teaching projects. For each case study, I recall the ecological question, then build the model step by step and conclude by discussing the results. The code and data are available **say where**.
