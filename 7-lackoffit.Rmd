## Individual heterogeneity

On wolf, see @cubaynes_importance_2010, @gimenez_individual_2010, or go full non-parametric w/ @turek_bayesian_2021. See @pradel2009 for black-headed gull example. 

Our example is about individual heterogeneity and how to account for it with HMMs. Gray wolf is a social species with hierarchy in packs which may reflect in species demography. As an example, we'll work with gray wolves.

```{r pixwolf, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Dominance in wolves.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wolfdominance.jpg")
```

Gray wolf is a social species with hierarchy in packs which may reflect in demography. Shirley Pledger in a series of papers developed heterogeneity models in which individuals are assigned in two or more classes with class-specific survival/detection probabilities. @cubaynes_importance_2010 used HMMs to account for heterogeneity in the detection process due to social status, see also @pradel2009. Dominant individuals tend to use path more often than others, and these paths are where we look for scats.

$\psi^{12}$ is the probability for an individual to change class of heterogeneity, from 1 to 2. $\psi^{21}$ is the probability for an individual to change class of heterogeneity, from 2 to 1.

$p^1$ is detection for individuals in class 1, and $p^2$ that of individuals in class 2.

Results

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(MCMCvis)
load(here::here("dat","wolf_het.RData"))
MCMCsummary(mcmc.phipmix, round = 2)
```

We have lowly detectable individuals (class A1 with $p^1$) in proportion 62%. And highly (or so) detectable individuals (class A2 with $p^2$) in proportion 38%. Note that interpretation of classes is made a posteriori. Survival is 81%.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

```

From the simulations I run, seems like the categorical sampler on latent states gets stuck in places that depend on initial values. Changing for the slice sampler improves thing a bit, but not that much. Only option is to get rid of the states and use the marginalized likelihood. Nice illustration of the use of simulations (to check model is doing ok, estimated are valid, etc.), changing samplers, nimbleEcology, NIMBLE functions, etc. 

You may consider more classes, and select among models, see @cubaynes2012. You may also go for a non-parametric approach and let the data tell you how many classes you need. This is relatively easy to do in NIMBLE, see @turek_bayesian_2021. More about individual heterogeneity in @gimenez2018ih.

> Bottom line, the way this model is written is completely destined for failure. The state-space formulation that's written, with the two different groups for individuals (high detection and low detection) sets the model up for failure, and it will never work correctly when written this way. Briefly:

> For any individual that is seen at any time t > 1 (that is, individuals seen again after the first sighting), the detection history looks something like:
1 0 0 1 .....  (1 represents detection).
The initial values for the latent z state are either :
1 1 1 1 1.....
or
2 2 2 2 2
putting that individual into one of the two groups (1 or 2 always).
when sampling, the latent z can *never * transition to the other group, from group 2 to group 1, or from group 1 to group 2.  It will be stuck where ever it started.
If the categorical sampler tries to change the *final* state from the initial value of (say) 2 to 1,
then this transition is deemed to be impossible by the prior (defined by the gamma state transition matrix), since the state at the previous time was 2, and 2 in one period (the previous period) does not permit a state of 1 in the next time period.
SImilarly, if the first (or any intermediate) value of z attempts to transition from (say) 2 to 1, then the *following* state is still 1, and that dependency does not allow the state in question to change to 1, because a state of 1 cannot have the next state be 2.
Even if some "dead" states (3's) are added to the end of the z vector over the course of MCMC sampling, and say z becomes:
1 1 1 1 3 3
The 3's can never propagate "earlier" than shown here (since there are detections at t=1 and t=4, so the individual cannot be in state 3 at time t=4), so the problem described above will always be the case, and this individual will *always* remain in group 1, no matter how long you run the MCMC.

> The only time an individual (with the model written as such) could change between groups (1 -> 2, or 2 -> 1) from their initial group assignment of zinit, would be if the individual is *only* observed on the first time period, the detection history is:
1 0 0 0 0 0,
Then say the initial value for z is:
1 1 1 1 1 1 (always in group 1),
then the sampler at some point could begin transitioning the final 1 into state 3 (dead), so after an MCMC iteration, the z for this individual could be:
1 1 1 1 1 3,
then if we're lucky, the sampler on the final 1 would some time change it to a 3:
1 1 1 1 3 3
then this could happen again later:
1 1 1 3 3 3
and again:
1 1 3 3 3 3
and once again:
1 3 3 3 3 3
and *only now*, finally, if we're lucky, the sampler operating on the first value of the z vector could change this group assignment from 1 to 2:
2 3 3 3 3 3
And that's the only situation when individuals can possibly change groups in this model.

> The problem again, is that any individual seen > 1 time (it's resighted after the first observation occasion) can *never* change group assignments away from their initial value group assignment.  So, this model is destined for failure.

> There are many ways one could fix this:
- Marginalize over the z's as you did (perhaps using nimbleEcology)
- Write the model differently, using a binary latent indicator variable to represent the group assignment of each individual.  This could also work for > 2 groups, where the group indicator variable follows a categorical prior
- Use a latent state formulation as you have, but write a custom MCMC sampler to update entire rows of the z matrix (the latent state variables for one individual for all time periods) simultaneously, thus enabling transitions between groups
- Probably other ways, also.


<!-- I'm not an expert on the BNP facilities offered in NIMBLE, but I think I can comment: the stick-breaking representation (as you're using), and the CRP distribution, are modelling the same Dirichlet process.  They differ in the MCMC sampling algorithms which are applied to each, automatically, by NIMBLE's MCMC.  Translating your code between these two (mathematically identical) representations is a relatively small and straight-forward exercise.  The relative performance of the different sampling algorithms, as applied to each representation, could differ, would depend on the model and the data, and is generally difficult to predict. -->

<!-- Changing between the stick-breaking representation and the CRP representation, the categorical distribution would persist in your model.  And Perry's comments are correct, that (in particular for a large number of categories, e.g. large values of H or HH in your code) the categorical sampler (which is applied to the categorical distribution) would become arbitrarily inefficient, in that it evaluates the posterior density for every category value (H or HH times), then samples directly from that posterior distribution.  And that you could hopefully reduce this inefficiency by writing a customized sampling strategy (a custom-written MCMC sampler), to update your categorical distributions, in a more efficient (less wasteful) manner. -->

## Memory model {#memorymodel}

How to make your models remember? 

So far, the dynamics of the states are first-order Makovian. The site where you will be depends only on the site where you are, and not on the sites you were previously. How to relax this assumption, and go second-order Markovian?
  
Memory models were initially proposed by @hestbeck1991estimates and @BrownieEtAl1993, then formulated as HMMs in @rouan2009memory. See also @cole2014.

HMM formulation of the memory model

To keep track of the sites previously visited, the trick is to consider states as being pairs of sites occupied

+ States
+ AA is for alive in site A at $t$ and alive in site A at $t-1$
+ AB is for alive in site A at $t$ and alive in site B at $t-1$
+ BA is for alive in site B at $t$ and alive in site A at $t-1$
+ BB is for alive in site B at $t$ and alive in site B at $t-1$
+ D is for dead

+ Observations
+ 1 not captured

## PROBLEM: p1 and p2 seem to be updated, but Rhat  = Inf and neff = 0; 
# inspecting their posterior distribution
## it feels like they are not updated, two modes corresp to the two chains. 
# Usually, it means that these parameters are not used in the model.

# Need to amend the way I simulate initial values!! 
# If z not needed, use weighted marginaled likelihood? And whole dataset!!

## Posterior predictive check {#ppchecks}

Classical m-array (minimal sufficient statistics for CJS model) as in @paganin2023computational. Individual performance in @chambert2014 and @nater2020trout. Sojourn time is geometric assumption in @conn2018.

For the CJS model, we would use the so-called m-array which gathers the elements $m_{ij}$ for the number of marked individuals initially released at time $i$ that were first detected again at time $j$. 

Refer to a case study. With m-array and Nimble functions. Refer to paper by Paganin & de Valpine and use code in https://github.com/salleuska/fastCPPP. Also papers by Chambert et al. (individual performance) and Conn et al. (geometric time, and hidden semi-Markov models).

<!-- This has an m-array structure. The number of individuals released at occasion $i$ ($R_i$) and the number of first recaptures at occasion $j$, given release at occasion $i$ ($m_{ij}$) are provided. For example, 38 birds were released in 1969 among which, 22 were first recaptured in 1970, and 16 (= 38 - 22) were never observed again. -->
