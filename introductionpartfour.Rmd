<!-- ## Take-home messages and recommendations -->

<!-- + We'll wrap up the workshop with a few take-home messages  -->
<!-- + And recommendations for conducting your own analyses. -->

<!-- ## Make the best of your data with HMMs -->

<!-- + Here is [a searchable list](applistHMM.html) of HMM analyses of capture-recapture data. -->

<!-- + We hope to have provided you with a useful overview of how to use hidden Markov models to analyze capture-recapture data.  -->
<!-- + We have only scratched the surface of what you can do with these models.  -->
<!-- + We have assembled a searchable list of HMM analyses of capture-recapture data to get inspiration.  -->

<!-- + This list is not exhaustive, please get in touch with us if you'd like to add a reference. -->

<!-- + It is not exhaustive, we'll continue updating it. Feel free to suggest papers to add to the list.  -->

<!-- ## Bayesian capture-recapture analysis with HMMs -->

<!-- + Before we leave, we'd like to give you a few pieces of advice. -->
<!-- + This is not rocket science. -->
<!-- + Just a few things based on our own experience of Bayesian capture-recapture analysis with HMMS. -->

<!-- + Make your ecological question explicit.  -->

<!-- + First things first. Make sure you've spent some to time to make your ecological question explicit.  -->
<!-- + This step will help you to stay on course, and make the right choices.  -->
<!-- + For example, it's ok to use subsets of your data to address different questions.  -->

<!-- + Think of observations and states first.  -->

<!-- + Now in terms of modeling. Don't jump on your keyboard right away.  -->
<!-- + Spend some time thinking about your model with pen and paper.  -->
<!-- + In particular make sure you have the observations and the states of your HMM.  -->

<!-- + Then write down the observation and transition matrices on paper.  -->

<!-- + Then write down the transition matrix. You may act as if you had no imperfect detection. This is really what you're after, the ecological process (survival, dispersal, etc).  -->
<!-- + Proceed with the observation matrix.  -->

<!-- + Start simple, all parameters constant for example. Make sure convergence is reached. -->

<!-- + When it comes to model fitting with Nimble, start simple.  -->
<!-- + Consider all parameters constant.  -->
<!-- + Make sure convergence is reached.  -->

<!-- + Add complexity one step at a time.  -->

<!-- + Then add complexity. Time effect for example. Or random effects. -->
<!-- + Or uncertainty in the assignment of states.  -->

<!-- ## Bayesian capture-recapture analysis with HMMs -->

<!-- + Use simulations to better understand your model.  -->

<!-- + Nimble models can be used to simulate data, check out [this tutorial](https://r-nimble.org/nimbleExamples/simulation_from_model.html).   -->

<!-- + When it comes to model building, consider simulating data to better understand your model.  -->
<!-- + You will always learn something on your model by seeing it an engine to generate data, instead of estimating its parameters. -->
<!-- + The cool thing with nimble is that you can you models to simulate data. There is a tutorial for that.   -->

<!-- + Do not try to optimize your code. Make it work first, then think of optimization.  -->

<!-- > ["Premature optimization is the root of all evil"](https://stackify.com/premature-optimization-evil/) - Donald Knuth (creator of TeX and author of ["The Art of Computer Programming"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming)) -->

<!-- + Another advice, quite general in programming, is to not try to optimize your code -->
<!-- + Or to try to make it elegant right away. Make it work first.  -->
<!-- + Then think of optimization.  -->

<!-- + Read [Bayesian workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808) by Gelman et al. (2021). -->

<!-- + More recommendations on Bayesian analyses in this recent paper by Gelman and collaborations.  -->
<!-- + They offer a workflow for bayesian analyses. -->
<!-- + In which they discuss model building, model comparison, model checking, model validation, model understanding and troubleshooting of computational problems. -->

<!-- <!-- --- --> -->
<!-- <!-- ## Nimble --> -->

<!-- <!-- + [TO BE COMPLETED BY ALL] --> -->

<!-- <!-- + Go for `nimbleMCMC()` if standard needs.  --> -->

<!-- <!-- + Unleash full `Nimble` potential for improving MCMC or implementing new distributions.  --> -->

<!-- ## Till next time -->

<!-- + The Slack space will remain for some time. Happy to answer questions you might have related to the workshop.  -->

<!-- + The Slack space will remain for some time.  -->
<!-- + We'll be happy to answer the questions you might have related to the workshop.  -->

<!-- + Website will be updated with -->

<!--     + video recordings -->
<!--     + your feedbacks -->
<!--     + a FAQ section based on your questions -->

<!-- + We will update the workshop website in the coming weeks.  -->
<!-- + With the video recordings of course.  -->
<!-- + Any feedback you might have. Please get in touch with me if you have any, that would be great.  -->
<!-- + Our plan is also to gather our exchanges in a Frequently Asked Questions section on the website.  -->

<!-- + A book is on its way. More in 2022 hopefully. -->

<!-- + And last, a book is on its way. Based on the material we used for the workshop and more stuff.  -->
<!-- + Also half the book will be about case studies reproducing analysis from published papers.  -->
<!-- + More in 2022 hopefully.  -->

<!-- ## Let's see if I can put to use my own pieces of advice - case studies -->
