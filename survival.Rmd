# Survival {#survival}

WORK IN PROGRESS.

## Introduction

In this fourth chapter, you will learn about the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model that allows estimating survival based on capture-recapture data. You will also see how to deal with covariates to try and explain temporal and/or individual variation in survival.  

## The Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model

In the previous chapter, we introduced a capture-recapture model with constant survival and detection probabilities which we formulated as a HMM and fitted to data in NIMBLE. Historically, however, it was a slightly more complicated model that was first proposed -- the so-called Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model -- in which survival and recapture probabilities are time-varying. This feature of the CJS model is useful to account for variation due to environmental conditions in survival or to sampling effort in detection. Schematically the CJS model can be represented this way:

```{r, engine = 'tikz', echo = FALSE}
\usetikzlibrary{arrows, fit, positioning, automata}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 2cm]
\tikzset{state/.style = {circle, draw, minimum size = 30pt, scale = 3, line width=1pt}}
\node [state,fill=lightgray!75] (6) [] {$1$};

\draw[->,black, line width=0.25mm,-latex] (8) -- node[above=3mm, align=center] {\huge $1$} (9);

\draw[->,black, line width=0.25mm,-latex] (7) -- node[left=3mm, align=center] {\huge $1$} (17);
\draw[->,black, line width=0.25mm,-latex] (8) -- node[left=3mm, align=center] {\huge $1$} (18);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

Note that the states (in gray) and the observations (in white) do not change. We still have $z = 1$ for alive, $z = 2$ for dead, $y = 1$ for non-detected, and $y = 2$ for detected. 

Parameters are now indexed by time. The survival probability is defined as the probability of staying alive (or "ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive" like the Bee Gees would say) over the interval between $t$ and $t+1$, that is $\phi_t = \Pr(z_{t+1} = 1 | z_t = 1)$. The detection probability is defined as the probability of being observed at $t$ given you're alive at $t$, that is $p_t = \Pr(y_{t} = 1 | z_t = 1)$. It is important to bear in mind that survival operates over an interval while detection occurs at a specific time. **Fast forward to covariates section?**

The CJS model is named after three statisticians who published independent sole-author papers introducing more or less the same approach, a year apart ! In fact, Richard Cormack and George Jolly were working in the same corridor in Scotland back in the 1960's. They would meet every day at coffee and would play some game together, but never mention work and were not aware of each other’s work.

## Capture-recapture data 

Before we turn to fitting the CJS model to actual data, let's talk about capture-recapture for a minute. We said in the previous chapter (section 1.6.1) that individuals are individual marked. This can be accomplished in two ways, either with artificial marks like rings for birds or ear tags for mammals, or (non-invasive) natural marks like coat patterns or feces DNA sequencing (Figure \@ref(fig:marking)). 

```{r marking, fig.ncol = 2, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Animal marks", fig.show = "hold", fig.subcap = c("ring", "ear-tag", "coat patters", "ADN feces"), out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/gull.jpg", 
                   "images/bighorn.png", 
                   "images/lynx.png", 
                   "images/bearscat.png"))
```

Throughout this chapter, we will use data on the White-throated Dipper (*Cinclus cinclus*; dipper hereafter) kindly provided by Gilbert Marzolin (Figure \@ref(fig:pixdipper)). In total, 294 dippers with known sex and wing length were captured and recaptured between 1981 and 1987 during the March-June period. Birds were at least 1 year old when initially banded. 

```{r pixdipper, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.cap="White-throated Dipper (Cinclus cinclus)", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Marzo_BaguesMance.jpg")
```

You may scroll down the data below: 

```{r echo = FALSE}
dipper <- read_csv(here::here("dat", "dipper.csv"))
dipper %>%
  kableExtra::kable() %>%
  kableExtra::scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px")
y <- dipper %>%
  select(year_1981:year_1987) %>%
  as.matrix()
```

The seven first columns are years in which Gilbert went on the field and captured the birds. A 0 stands for a non-detection, and a 1 for a detection. The eighth column informs on the sex of the bird, with F for female and M for male. The last column gives a measure wing length the first time a bird was captured. 

## Fitting the CJS model to the dipper data with NIMBLE

To write the NIMBLE code corresponding to the CJS model, we only need to make a few adjustments to the NIMBLE code for the model with constant parameters from the previous chapter. The main modification concerns the observation and transitions matrices which we need to be time-varying and therefore become arrays and inherit a third dimension besides that for rows and columns. Also we need priors for all time-varying survival and detection probabilities. We get:

```{r eval=FALSE}
...
# parameters
  delta[1] <- 1          # Pr(alive t = 1) = 1
  delta[2] <- 0          # Pr(dead t = 1) = 0
  for (t in 1:(T-1)){
    phi[t] ~ dunif(0, 1) # prior survival
    gamma[1,1,t] <- phi[t]      # Pr(alive t -> alive t+1)
    gamma[1,2,t] <- 1 - phi[t]  # Pr(alive t -> dead t+1)
    gamma[2,1,t] <- 0        # Pr(dead t -> alive t+1)
    gamma[2,2,t] <- 1        # Pr(dead t -> dead t+1)
    p[t] ~ dunif(0, 1) # prior detection
    omega[1,1,t] <- 1 - p[t]    # Pr(alive t -> non-detected t)
    omega[1,2,t] <- p[t]        # Pr(alive t -> detected t)
    omega[2,1,t] <- 1        # Pr(dead t -> non-detected t)
    omega[2,2,t] <- 0        # Pr(dead t -> detected t)
  }
...
```

The likelihood does not change, except that the time-varying observation and transition matrices need to be used appropriately:
```{r eval=FALSE}
...
# likelihood
  for (i in 1:N){
    z[i,first[i]] ~ dcat(delta[1:2])
    for (j in (first[i]+1):T){
      z[i,j] ~ dcat(gamma[z[i,j-1], 1:2, j-1])
      y[i,j] ~ dcat(omega[z[i,j], 1:2, j-1])
    }
  }
...
```

Overall, the code looks like:
```{r}
hmm.phitpt <- nimbleCode({
  # parameters
  delta[1] <- 1          # Pr(alive t = 1) = 1
  delta[2] <- 0          # Pr(dead t = 1) = 0
  for (t in 1:(T-1)){
    phi[t] ~ dunif(0, 1) # prior survival
    gamma[1,1,t] <- phi[t]      # Pr(alive t -> alive t+1)
    gamma[1,2,t] <- 1 - phi[t]  # Pr(alive t -> dead t+1)
    gamma[2,1,t] <- 0        # Pr(dead t -> alive t+1)
    gamma[2,2,t] <- 1        # Pr(dead t -> dead t+1)
    p[t] ~ dunif(0, 1) # prior detection
    omega[1,1,t] <- 1 - p[t]    # Pr(alive t -> non-detected t)
    omega[1,2,t] <- p[t]        # Pr(alive t -> detected t)
    omega[2,1,t] <- 1        # Pr(dead t -> non-detected t)
    omega[2,2,t] <- 0        # Pr(dead t -> detected t)
  }
  # likelihood
  for (i in 1:N){
    z[i,first[i]] ~ dcat(delta[1:2])
    for (j in (first[i]+1):T){
      z[i,j] ~ dcat(gamma[z[i,j-1], 1:2, j-1])
      y[i,j] ~ dcat(omega[z[i,j], 1:2, j-1])
    }
  }
})
```

We read in the data:
```{r}
dipper <- read_csv(here::here("dat", "dipper.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE)
y <- dipper %>%
  select(year_1981:year_1987) %>%
  as.matrix()
```

Get the occasion of first capture for all individuals: **Say several cohorts, different from prevcious chapter example**
```{r}
first <- apply(y, 1, function(x) min(which(x !=0)))
```

Now we specify the constants:
```{r}
my.constants <- list(N = nrow(y), T = ncol(y), first = first)
my.constants
```
Now the data in a list. Note that we add 1 to the data to have 1 for non-detections and 2 for detections. You may use the coding you prefer of course, you will just need to adjust the $\Omega$ and $\Gamma$ matrices in the model above.
```{r}
my.data <- list(y = y + 1)
```

Now let's write a function for the initial values. For the latent states, we go for the easy way, and say that all individuals are alive through the study period. 
```{r}
zinits <- y + 1 # non-detection -> alive
zinits[zinits == 2] <- 1 # dead -> alive
initial.values <- function() list(phi = runif(my.constants$T-1,0,1),
                                  p = runif(my.constants$T-1,0,1),
                                  z = zinits)
```

We specify the parameters we'd like to monitor:
```{r}
parameters.to.save <- c("phi", "p")
parameters.to.save
```

We provide MCMC details:
```{r}
n.iter <- 5000
n.burnin <- 1000
n.chains <- 2
```

At last, we're ready to run NIMBLE:
```{r, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
mcmc.output <- nimbleMCMC(code = hmm.phitpt,
                          constants = my.constants,
                          data = my.data,
                          inits = initial.values,
                          monitors = parameters.to.save,
                          niter = n.iter,
                          nburnin = n.burnin,
                          nchains = n.chains)
```

We may have a look to the numerical summaries. **Comment on variation in survival, and constancy in detection. And write example of how to interpret these estimates.** Note the small effective sample size for the last survival and recapture probabilities, we will get back to that in a minute. 
```{r eval = FALSE}
MCMCsummary(mcmc.output, round = 2)
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
load(here::here("dat","dipper.RData"))
MCMCsummary(object = mcmc.phitpt, params = c("phi","p"), round = 2)
```

Let's produce a caterpillar plot of the estimates.
```{r}
MCMCplot(object = mcmc.phitpt, params = c("phi","p"))
```

Let's focus for a minute on the last survival probability. See how mixing is bad and the overlap with the prior is big. This parameter is redundant, and it can be shown that only the product of $\phi_6$ and $p_7$ can be estimated.
```{r}
priors <- runif(3000, 0, 1)
MCMCtrace(object = mcmc.phitpt,
          ISB = FALSE,
          exact = TRUE, 
          params = c("phi[6]"),
          pdf = FALSE, 
          priors = priors)
```

There are two potential issues, either intrinsic or extrinsic parameter redundacy. Intrinsic redundancy means that the model likelihood can be expressed by a smaller number of parameters; it is a feature of the model. Extrinsic redundancymeans that model structure is fine, but the lack of data makes a parameter non-estimable; this is a feature of the data. **Recommendation overlap, et refer to book by Diana Cole.**

## CJS model derivatives

Besides the model we fitted in the previous chapter with constant parameters and the CJS model with time-varying parameters, you might want to fit in-between models with time variation on either detection or survival. 

Let's start with the model with time-varying survival and constant detection. In NIMBLE, the code is:
```{r eval=FALSE}
hmm.phitp <- nimbleCode({
  for (t in 1:(T-1)){
    phi[t] ~ dunif(0, 1) # prior survival
    gamma[1,1,t] <- phi[t]      # Pr(alive t -> alive t+1)
    gamma[1,2,t] <- 1 - phi[t]  # Pr(alive t -> dead t+1)
    gamma[2,1,t] <- 0        # Pr(dead t -> alive t+1)
    gamma[2,2,t] <- 1        # Pr(dead t -> dead t+1)
  }
  p ~ dunif(0, 1) # prior detection
  delta[1] <- 1          # Pr(alive t = 1) = 1
  delta[2] <- 0          # Pr(dead t = 1) = 0
  omega[1,1] <- 1 - p    # Pr(alive t -> non-detected t)
  omega[1,2] <- p        # Pr(alive t -> detected t)
  omega[2,1] <- 1        # Pr(dead t -> non-detected t)
  omega[2,2] <- 0        # Pr(dead t -> detected t)
  # likelihood
  for (i in 1:N){
    z[i,first[i]] ~ dcat(delta[1:2])
    for (j in (first[i]+1):T){
      z[i,j] ~ dcat(gamma[z[i,j-1], 1:2, j-1])
      y[i,j] ~ dcat(omega[z[i,j], 1:2])
    }
  }
})
```

We obtain the following estimates: **comment**
```{r echo = FALSE}
load(here::here("dat","dipper.RData"))
MCMCsummary(object = mcmc.phitp, params = c("phi","p"), round = 2)
```

Now the model with time-varying detection and constant survival, for which the NIMBLE code is:
```{r eval=FALSE}
hmm.phipt <- nimbleCode({
  phi ~ dunif(0, 1) # prior survival
  gamma[1,1] <- phi      # Pr(alive t -> alive t+1)
  gamma[1,2] <- 1 - phi  # Pr(alive t -> dead t+1)
  gamma[2,1] <- 0        # Pr(dead t -> alive t+1)
  gamma[2,2] <- 1        # Pr(dead t -> dead t+1)
  delta[1] <- 1          # Pr(alive t = 1) = 1
  delta[2] <- 0          # Pr(dead t = 1) = 0
  for (t in 1:(T-1)){
    p[t] ~ dunif(0, 1) # prior detection
    omega[1,1,t] <- 1 - p[t]    # Pr(alive t -> non-detected t)
    omega[1,2,t] <- p[t]        # Pr(alive t -> detected t)
    omega[2,1,t] <- 1        # Pr(dead t -> non-detected t)
    omega[2,2,t] <- 0        # Pr(dead t -> detected t)
  }
  # likelihood
  for (i in 1:N){
    z[i,first[i]] ~ dcat(delta[1:2])
    for (j in (first[i]+1):T){
      z[i,j] ~ dcat(gamma[z[i,j-1], 1:2])
      y[i,j] ~ dcat(omega[z[i,j], 1:2, j-1])
    }
  }
})
```

Parameter estimates are: **comment**
```{r echo = FALSE}
load(here::here("dat","dipper.RData"))
MCMCsummary(object = mcmc.phipt, params = c("phi","p"), round = 2)
```

We're left with four models. Different ecological hypotheses. What to do from here? Model selection. **A raffiner**

## Model selection via WAIC

How to select a best model? Model selection. Which of the four models above is best supported by the data? The idea is to penalize models with too many parameters. 

In Frequentist, Akaike information criterion (AIC) with $AIC = - 2 \log(L(\hat{\theta}_1,\ldots,\hat{\theta}_K)) + 2 K$ where $L$ the likelihood and $K$ the number of parameters $\theta_i$. First term is a measure of goodness-of-fit of the model to the data: the more parameters you have, the smaller the deviance is (or the bigger the likelihood is). Second term is a penalty: twice the number of parameters $K$. AIC makes the balance between *quality of fit* and *complexity* of a model. Best model is the one with lowest AIC value.

Bayesian version exists with Watanabe-Akaike (Widely-Applicable) Information Criteria or WAIC given by $\textrm{WAIC} = -2 \sum_{i = 1}^n \log E[\Pr(y_i \mid \theta)] + 2 p_\text{WAIC}$ where $E[p(y_i \mid \theta)]$ is the posterior mean of the likelihood evaluated pointwise at each $i$th observation, and $p_\text{WAIC}$ is a penalty computed using the posterior variance of the likelihood.

NIMBLE provides the conditional WAIC, where all parameters directly involved in the likelihood are considered. If you would want to calculate the marginal WAIC, integrating over latent variables, you could monitor the relevant nodes and carry out the calculations yourself based on the MCMC output.

How to compute WAIC in NIMBLE? E.g. for model from previous chapter. **explain**
```{r eval = FALSE}
parameters.to.save <- c("phi", "p", "z") 
mcmc.phitpt <- nimbleMCMC(code = hmm.phitpt,
                          constants = my.constants,
                          data = my.data,
                          inits = initial.values,
                          monitors = parameters.to.save,
                          niter = n.iter,
                          nburnin = n.burnin,
                          nchains = n.chains,
                          WAIC = TRUE) 
```

Dipper example - continued

```{r echo = FALSE}
load(here::here("dat","dipper_waic.RData"))
data.frame(model = c("(phi,p)",
                     "(phit,p)",
                     "(phi,pt)",
                     "(phit,pt)"),
           WAIC = c(mcmc.phip$WAIC,
             mcmc.phitp$WAIC,
             mcmc.phipt$WAIC,
             mcmc.phitpt$WAIC))
```


## Why Bayes? Incorporate prior information

So far, we have assumed a vague prior $\phi_{prior} \sim \text{Beta}(1,1) = \text{Uniform}(0,1)$. With a vague prior, mean posterior survival is $\phi_{posterior} = 0.56$, with credible interval $[0.52,0.62]$

```{r, echo = FALSE}
load(here::here("dat","dipper.RData"))
PR <- runif(1500, 0, 1)
MCMCtrace(mcmc.phip,
          params = c('phi'),
          ISB = FALSE,
          exact = TRUE,
          priors = PR,
          pdf = FALSE,
          Rhat = FALSE,
          n.eff = FALSE,
#          post_zm = TRUE,
          sz_txt = NULL,
          ind = TRUE,
          type = "density",
          lwd_den = 3,
          lwd_pr = 3,
          col_pr = "gray70",
          lty_pr = 2,
          main_den = "",
          xlab_den = "survival")
```

Posterior distribution of survival in color (two chains), prior in gray dashed line.

How to incorporate prior information? Using information on body mass and annual survival of 27 European passerines, we can predict survival of European dippers using only body mass.

For dippers, body mass is 59.8g, therefore $\phi = 0.57$ with $\text{sd} = 0.073$. Assuming an informative prior $\phi_{prior} \sim \text{Normal}(0.57,0.073^2)$. Mean posterior $\phi_{posterior} = 0.56$ with credible interval $[0.52, 0.61]$. No increase of precision in posterior inference. Disapointment. 

Now if you had only the three first years of data, what would have happened? Width of credible interval is 0.53 (vague prior) vs. 0.24 (informative prior). Huge increase of precision in posterior inference, a $120\%$ gain!

Compare survival posterior with and without informative prior
```{r, echo = FALSE}
load(here::here("dat","phip3y.RData"))
phinoprior <- c(mcmc.phip$chain1[,"phi"], mcmc.phip$chain2[,"phi"])
load(here::here("dat","phipriorp3y.RData"))
phiprior <- c(mcmc.phip$chain1[,"phi"], mcmc.phip$chain2[,"phi"])
df <- data.frame(posterior = c(phinoprior, phiprior),
                 type = c(rep("w/ vague prior", length(phinoprior)),
                          rep("w/ informative prior", length(phiprior))))
df %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = posterior, fill = type) +
  geom_density(aes(y = ..density..),
               bins = 40,
               color = "white",
               alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(x = "survival", fill = "") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = wesanderson::wes_palette("Royal1")[2:1])
```

The prior $\phi_{prior} \sim \text{Normal}(0.57,0.073^2)$ is not entirely satisfying. Use of normal distribution for prior. Problem. Can we do better? Prior elicitation via moment matching. 

Remember the Beta distribution. Recall that the Beta distribution is a continuous distribution with values between 0 and 1. Useful for modelling survival or detection probabilities. If $X \sim Beta(\alpha,\beta)$, then the first and second moments of $X$ are $\mu = \text{E}(X) = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}$ and $\sigma^2 = \text{Var}(X) = \frac{\alpha\beta}{(\alpha + \beta)^2 (\alpha + \beta + 1)}$. 

In the capture-recapture example, we know a priori that the mean of the probability we're interested in is $\mu = 0.57$ and its variance is $\sigma^2 = 0.073^2$. Parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ are seen as the moments of a $Beta(\alpha,\beta)$ distribution. Now we look for values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ that match the observed moments of the Beta distribution $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$. We need another set of equations:
$$\alpha = \bigg(\frac{1-\mu}{\sigma^2}- \frac{1}{\mu} \bigg)\mu^2$$
$$\beta = \alpha \bigg(\frac{1}{\mu}-1\bigg)$$
For our model, that means:

```{r echo = TRUE}
(alpha <- ( (1 - 0.57)/(0.073*0.073) - (1/0.57) )*0.57^2)
(beta <- alpha * ( (1/0.57) - 1))
```

Now use $\phi_{prior} \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha = 25.6,\beta = 19.3)$ instead of $\phi_{prior} \sim \text{Normal}(0.57,0.073^2)$. 

## Capture-recapture model assumptions

Models rely on assumptions.

Design: No mark lost, Identity of individuals recorded without error (no false positives), Captured individuals are a random sample.

Model: Homogeneity of survival and recapture probabilities, Independence between individuals (overdispersion).

Test validity of assumptions: These assumptions should be valid, whatever inferential framework, Use goodness-of-fit tests <span>&#8212;</span> Pradel et al. (2005), `R` implementation with [package `R2ucare`](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13014). Posterior predictive checks can also be used ([Gelman et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01808.pdf)). Make distinction between omnibus vs. directional tests (two-sided vs one-sided). 

What does survival actually mean in capture-recapture ? Survival refers to the study area. Mortality and permanent emigration are confounded. Therefore we estimate apparent survival, not true survival. Apparent survival probability = true survival × study area fidelity. Consequently, apparent survival < true survival unless study area fidelity = 1. Use caution with interpretation. 

## Covariates

Proportion of variance explained. Path analyses, structural equation models. Splines (more about spatial stats? CAR model?). Imputation and multistate models to account for missing data. Explain basics of parametric statistical modeling (linear models, GLMs and random effects).

Talk about ANODEV?

### Can we explain time variation? Embrace heterogeneity

+ Include temporal covariates, say $x_t$.

+ $\text{logit}(\phi_t) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x_t$.

+ Let's investigate the effect of water flow on dipper survival ([Marzolin 2002](https://doi.org/10.2307/3802934)).

```{r eval = FALSE}
hmm.phiflowp <- nimbleCode({
  delta[1] <- 1          # Pr(alive t = 1) = 1
  delta[2] <- 0          # Pr(dead t = 1) = 0
  for (t in 1:(T-1)){
    logit(phi[t]) <- beta[1] + beta[2] * flow[t] #<<
    gamma[1,1,t] <- phi[t]      # Pr(alive t -> alive t+1)
    gamma[1,2,t] <- 1 - phi[t]  # Pr(alive t -> dead t+1)
    gamma[2,1,t] <- 0        # Pr(dead t -> alive t+1)
    gamma[2,2,t] <- 1        # Pr(dead t -> dead t+1)
  }
  p ~ dunif(0, 1) # prior detection
  omega[1,1] <- 1 - p    # Pr(alive t -> non-detected t)
  omega[1,2] <- p        # Pr(alive t -> detected t)
  omega[2,1] <- 1        # Pr(dead t -> non-detected t)
  omega[2,2] <- 0        # Pr(dead t -> detected t)
  beta[1] ~ dnorm(0, 1.5) # prior intercept #<<
  beta[2] ~ dnorm(0, 1.5) # prior slope #<<
  # likelihood
  for (i in 1:N){
    z[i,first[i]] ~ dcat(delta[1:2])
    for (j in (first[i]+1):T){
      z[i,j] ~ dcat(gamma[z[i,j-1], 1:2, j-1])
      y[i,j] ~ dcat(omega[z[i,j], 1:2])
    }
  }
})
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# water flow in L/s
water_flow <- c(443, 1114, 529, 434, 627, 466) # 1981, 1982, ..., 1987
water_flow_st <- (water_flow - mean(water_flow))/sd(water_flow) #<<
```
]

```{r eval = FALSE}
my.constants <- list(N = nrow(y),
                     T = ncol(y),
                     first = first,

                                  z = zinits)

parameters.to.save <- c("beta", "p", "phi")
```

Regression intercept and slope

```{r, echo = FALSE}
load(here::here("dat/dipperflow.RData"))
MCMCplot(object = mcmc.phiflowp, params = "beta", ISB = TRUE)
```

Time-dependent (covariate constrained) survival probability estimates

```{r, echo = FALSE}
load(here::here("dat/dipperflow.RData"))
MCMCplot(object = mcmc.phiflowp, params = "phi", ISB = TRUE)
```

### Embrace heterogeneity

+ Include temporal covariates, say $x_t$

+ $\text{logit}(\phi_t) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x_t$

+ If temporal variation not fully explained by covariates, add random effects

+ $\text{logit}(\phi_t) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x_t + \varepsilon_t, \; \varepsilon_t \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$

```{r eval = FALSE}
hmm.phiflowREp <- nimbleCode({
  for (t in 1:(T-1)){
    logit(phi[t]) <- beta[1] + beta[2] * flow[t] + eps[t]
    eps[t] ~ dnorm(0, sd = sdeps)
    ...
  }
  sdeps ~ dunif(0,10)
  ...
```

### What about individual heterogeneity?

+ Discrete covariate like, e.g., sex

+ Continuous covariate like, e.g., mass or size

Sex and wing length in Dipper

```{r echo = FALSE}
dipper %>%
  kableExtra::kable() %>%
  kableExtra::scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px")
```

Sex effect

+ Let's use a covariate $\text{sex}$ that takes value 0 if male, and 1 if female

+ And write $\text{logit}(\phi_i) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \; \text{sex}_i$ for bird $i$

+ Then male survival is

$$\text{logit}(\phi_i) = \beta_1$$

+ And female survival is

$$\text{logit}(\phi_i) = \beta_1 + \beta_2$$

Nimble implementation with sex as a covariate

```{r eval = FALSE}
hmm.phisexp <- nimbleCode({
...
  for (i in 1:N){ #<<
    logit(phi[i]) <- beta[1] + beta[2] * sex[i] #<<
    gamma[1,1,i] <- phi[i]      # Pr(alive t -> alive t+1)
    gamma[1,2,i] <- 1 - phi[i]  # Pr(alive t -> dead t+1)
    gamma[2,1,i] <- 0        # Pr(dead t -> alive t+1)
    gamma[2,2,i] <- 1        # Pr(dead t -> dead t+1)
  } #<<
  beta[1] ~ dnorm(mean = 0, sd = 1.5) #<<
  beta[2] ~ dnorm(mean = 0, sd = 1.5) #<<
  phi_male <- 1/(1+exp(-beta[1])) #<<
  phi_female <- 1/(1+exp(-(beta[1]+beta[2]))) #<<
...
  # likelihood
  for (i in 1:N){
    z[i,first[i]] ~ dcat(delta[1:2])
    for (j in (first[i]+1):T){
      z[i,j] ~ dcat(gamma[z[i,j-1], 1:2, i]) #<<
      y[i,j] ~ dcat(omega[z[i,j], 1:2])
    }
  }
})
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
load(here::here("dat/phisexp.RData"))
MCMCsummary(object = mcmc.phisexp, round = 2)
```


Nimble implementation with nested indexing

+ Let's use a covariate $\text{sex}$ that contains 1s and 2s, indicating the sex of each individual: 1 if male, and 2 if female

```{r eval = FALSE}
...
for (i in 1:N){
  phi[i] <- beta[sex[i]] #<<
  gamma[1,1,i] <- phi[i]      # Pr(alive t -> alive t+1)
  gamma[1,2,i] <- 1 - phi[i]  # Pr(alive t -> dead t+1)
  gamma[2,1,i] <- 0           # Pr(dead t -> alive t+1)
  gamma[2,2,i] <- 1           # Pr(dead t -> dead t+1)
}
beta[1] ~ dunif(0,1) # male survival #<<
beta[2] ~ dunif(0,1) # female survival #<<
...
```

+ E.g. for individual $i = 2$, `beta[sex[i]]` gives `beta[sex[2]]` which will be `beta[1]` or `beta[2]` depending on whether sex[2] is 1 or 2.

```{r echo = FALSE}
load(here::here("dat/phisexpni.RData"))
MCMCsummary(object = mcmc.phisexp.ni, round = 2)
```

What about wing length?

```{r eval = FALSE}
...
  for (i in 1:N){ #<<
    logit(phi[i]) <- beta[1] + beta[2] * winglength[i] #<<
    gamma[1,1,i] <- phi[i]      # Pr(alive t -> alive t+1)
    gamma[1,2,i] <- 1 - phi[i]  # Pr(alive t -> dead t+1)
    gamma[2,1,i] <- 0        # Pr(dead t -> alive t+1)
    gamma[2,2,i] <- 1        # Pr(dead t -> dead t+1)
  }
  beta[1] ~ dnorm(mean = 0, sd = 1.5) # intercept #<<
  beta[2] ~ dnorm(mean = 0, sd = 1.5) # slope #<<
...
```

Wing length

```{r, echo = FALSE}
load(here::here("dat/phiwingp.RData"))
beta1 <- c(mcmc.phiwlp$chain1[,'beta[1]'], mcmc.phiwlp$chain2[,'beta[1]'])
beta2 <- c(mcmc.phiwlp$chain1[,'beta[2]'], mcmc.phiwlp$chain2[,'beta[2]'])
wing.length.st <- as.vector(scale(dipper$wing_length))
predicted_survival <- matrix(NA,
                             nrow = length(beta1),
                             ncol = length(wing.length.st))
for (i in 1:length(beta1)){
  for (j in 1:length(wing.length.st)){
    predicted_survival[i,j] <- plogis(beta1[i] + beta2[i] * wing.length.st[j])
  }
}
mean_survival <- apply(predicted_survival, 2, mean)
lci <- apply(predicted_survival, 2, quantile, prob = 2.5/100)
uci <- apply(predicted_survival, 2, quantile, prob = 97.5/100)
ord <- order(wing.length.st)
df <- data.frame(wing_length = wing.length.st[ord],
                 survival = mean_survival[ord],
                 lci = lci[ord],
                 uci = uci[ord])
df %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = wing_length, y = survival) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lci, ymax = uci), fill = "grey70", alpha = 0.5) +
  ylim(0,1) +
  labs(x = "wing length", y = "estimated survival")
```

+ You may test an effect of both sex and wing length, see exercise in Worksheets.

### What if covariates vary with individual and time?

+ Think of age for example (see exercises in Worksheets); covariate or nested indexing works fine.

+ Now, think of body size across life.

+ Problem is we cannot record size when animal is non-detected.

+ Discretize in small, medium and large and treat as a state <span>&#8212;</span> more later.

+ Assume a model for covariate and fill in missing values (imputation).
