<!-- bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::pdf_book") -->

Welcome to the online version of the book *Bayesian analysis of capture-recapture data with hidden Markov models: Theory and case studies in R and NIMBLE*. <!-- The book is also available in [PDF format](https://github.com/oliviergimenez/banana-book/raw/master/docs/bayesHMMcapturerecapture.pdf). -->  Here, I write about three of my favorite research topics -- capture-recapture, hidden Markov models and Bayes statistics -- let's enjoy this great cocktail together `r emo::ji("tropical_drink")`

I'm currently writing this book, and I welcome any feedback. You may raise an issue [here](https://github.com/oliviergimenez/banana-book/issues), amend directly the R Markdown file that generated the page you're reading by clicking on the 'Edit this page' icon in the right panel, or [email me](mailto:olivier.gimenez@cefe.cnrs.fr). Many thanks!
